Demo project for the 2015 PSU MacAdmins Conference.

"Doing a cow thing."

This app allows you to install the wonderful [cowsay][1] program on your Mac, then type in text for the cow to speak. The system voice will be used to speak while the output from the cowsay program is displayed in a text view. Enjoy.
